                    My career in events began working as an events intern at experiential agency Bearded Kitten in London, England. At this internship, I developed a foundation in large-scale creative production and immersive brand storytelling. At BK, I worked with local companies, such as Wilderness Festival, along with global corporations including Disney, Google's DeepMind, and Pernod Ricard. This experience was fundamental in shaping my love for creative events and event planning. 
</p>
                    After graduating from my undergraduate program, I landed a full-time role, serving as an Event Manager at Toronto's prestigious wedding venue, Graydon Hall Manor. My role at GHM specialized in high-end wedding coordination and luxury client experience. During my time as Event Manager, I crafted and executed over 40+ intimate wedding, birthday and party celebrations. 
<p>
                In hopes of trying something new, I left my role at Graydon Hall Manor to return to university and pursue my master's degree. I continue to work in events, yet in a new environment. I'm currently an Event Coordinator at Toronto Metropolitan University, supporting the Creative Industries and Professional Music Programs with their events across campus, from large-scale (300+ guests) to small-scale (10+ guests). 

            My work blends logistics, creative strategy, and human-centred design to craft experiences that feel intentional, seamless, and emotionally resonant. </p>

                    <p> As a creative, I am always working on my passion projects and creative practice centred on visual storytelling, documentary filmmaking, and digital content creation. During my international exchange semester in Denmark, I co-produced a music documentary <em>Sauna Senere: The Journey to Spot</em> with my fellow classmates. The process of working on this documentary was unforgettable as we followed the local Danish band for the weeks leading up to Spot festival, Denmark's largest showcase festival. 

                        <p> In addition, I've also created short travel and lifestyle content through my TikTok (@tiptoeto) and YouTube platforms, exploring global spaces, travel, creative communities, and lived experience through film.

            <div class="dropdown-content">
                <p>
                    <p> Beyond events and media, I am deeply passionate about education, travel, and cultural exchange. My love for travel began in 2017, when my mom and I took a March Break trip to Iceland. She gave me the responsibility of planning our entire six-day itinerary, and I embraced the challenge. That experience sparked not only my passion for travel but also my love for planning and curating meaningful experiences. Since then, I’ve visited 28 countries (and lived abroad in 5 countries), with many more destinations still on my bucket list. Some of my favourite places so far include Penang in Malaysia, Hong Kong, and my all-time favourite, London, England. <p> 
I’m also a major foodie. I love exploring new cuisines both in Toronto and abroad, and I enjoy experimenting in the kitchen with new ingredients and recipes. Some of my favourite dishes to make include pork belly ramen and vegetarian chickpea coconut curry. As for drinks, I’m an avid bubble tea lover and recently developed a serious appreciation for matcha, especially the Spiced Cherry Matcha from Dark Horse Espresso Bar in Toronto.
<p> 
    Some may also call me a bit of a concert lover as well. Live music and events are my thing, and I'll always make up an excuse to see my favourite artists and bands live. The best shows I've seen have been Taylor Swift's The Eras Tour, which I went to in Zurich, Switzerland, with friends, The 1975's Reading Festival 2022 set, and Harry Styles' Love on Tour in 2023. 
   <p>  
    <h3>I'm also a lover of...</h3>

<ul class="interests">
    <li>Trying funky nail designs</li>
    <li>Pop and alternative music</li>
    <li>Popmart blind boxes</li>
    <li>Board games</li>
    <li>Cats, dogs, and all other cute fuzzy animals</li>
</ul>

In Summer 2025, I volunteered for three months as an English teacher in Hanoi, Vietnam, supporting youth and adult language development through cross-cultural learning. That experience deepened my appreciation for Vietnamese culture and taught me a great deal about myself. It also strengthened my desire to continue working in education. I currently work as an Academic Assistant at Toronto Metropolitan University, where I support and teach students in the Creative Industries and Professional Communications undergraduate programs. Whether in the classroom, abroad, or behind the camera, I am driven by a commitment to connection, lifelong learning, and global perspective.
